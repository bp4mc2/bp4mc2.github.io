# Anchor modeling and linked data

Anchor is an agile database modeling technique suited for information that changes over time both in structure and content. It provides a graphical notation used for conceptual modeling similar to that of entity-relationship modeling, with extensions for working with temporal data. The modeling technique involves four modeling constructs: the anchor, attribute, tie and knot, each capturing different aspects of the domain being modeled.[1] The resulting models can be translated to physical database designs using formalized rules. When such a translation is done the tables in the relational database will mostly be in the sixth normal form. (Source: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor_modeling)).

Anchor modeling is a conceptual modeling style and doesn't directly relate to a storage model. Currently, however, the usual implementation of an anchor model is a relational database.

This means that the highly flexable nature of an anchor modeling is usually transformed to the fixed schema of a relation database. Although clever transformation rules are used to minimize the risked of losing the advantages of the anchor modeling, the original anchor model graph structure is lost in the fixed table-oriented relation database.

A more natural approach might be to transform the anchor model to a RDF model. Both models are graph models and have the same characteristics regarding flexibility and expressibility.

This page describes the transformation rules that can be used to transform an anchor model to a RDF model. It also defines a RDF vocabulary to be used for anchor modeling. An example (from [anchormodeling.com](http://www.anchormodeling.com)) is used for the transformation itself. A XSL stylesheet is included to transform the XML serialization of an anchor (as generated by the [online tool](http://www.anchormodeling.com/modeler/latest/)) to the corresponding RDF model.
