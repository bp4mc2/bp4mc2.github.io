# SKOS-Lex application profile for (legal) acts


Events can be described as concepts. They then have the same characteristics as concepts, which denote 'objects', but they also have some other characteristics.
* Events are described in legislation and regulations as possible (legal) acts that can take place in a certain domain. An example is the exploitation of a marina in the area of the decree on Activities in the Environment (in Dutch â€˜Besluit Activiteiten Leefomgeving/BAL).
* Events make the dynamics of institutional reality visible. A change in the registration can be referenced c to the event. This helps to understand 'what has happened' around the change. An example is a new owner of property in the BRK. In this case it can be recorded that this situation arose through a transfer, inheritance, estate distribution, etc.
* An event relates to an object. This object is an 'ordinary' concept. In the example of the transfer in the BRK, the object is the property.
* Institutional events or legal acts have one or more actors, for example the seller and the buyer in the transfer of property. In cases where the legislation and regulations are primarily intended to describe the rules (norms), an actor is called in Dutch a norm adressee. Actors are also 'ordinary' concepts.
* Not everyone is authorized to record an institutional event. This is done by an official or by a civil-law notary. This is called an 'agent'. This is a special kind of actor.
* Finally, there are the rules or norms that a legal act must meet. Norms are not concepts.
